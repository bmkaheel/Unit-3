# Unit-3

Talk about whats contained in the repository, why i chose the data I did, what sorts of target areas the subsets I created are supposed to be used for.


- Provenance (where did this data/code come from)
- Purpose ( what/who is this data/code for)
- Potential ( why was this repo created and what might people do with it)
