# County Health Data

### Description of the Data

This data is provided to improve the quality of health on a **county** level and the quantity of healthy individuals. The data in this repository is collected from the year **2014-2015**, yet trends continue until this day. The dataset is designed in a comparative manner. Health of individuals at the county level is provided, along with much more data regarding probable explanations. These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the [Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/data/) of the University of North Carolina at Chapel-Hill's Davis Library.


### Accessing the Data and Jupyter Notebooks

Above this [README](https://github.com/bmkaheel/Unit-3/blob/main/README.md) file, I have attached all the notebooks and data that are related to this project. Whenever needed for referenece or anything, you can simply access them by scrolling up and clicking on them. You can duplicate the tab and have them opened side-by-side or however feels best for you.


### Examples of Analysis Areas

Everyone is constantly struggling in their own battle and counties are, too. For example, some counties have may have better access to education while others don't. Provided with this data, we are able to analyze it and determine where each county lacks in order to achieve exemplary health numbers. Analysis areas that can be seen through this data consist of, but are *not limited to*:

1.) accessibility to adequate healthcare and healthcare coverage,

2.) likelihood of bad habits (such as alcohol and tobacco-use),

3.) and extent of funding in a specific community.


### Benefit of Data Visualization

A county's health rate can increase tremendously through visualization of this dataset. Data visualization leads to a greater understanding of the numbers in the data. Through the use of data visualization in this data, we are able to better understand why some counties have lower health numbers than others.


### Tobacco and Alcohol-Use Visualization

### Understanding our Data Visuals

When we look at the charts above, they may seem as a couple different shades of blue put on a map of North Carolina but that is not the case. The different shades of blue indicate something: 

- different levels of either tobacco-use (in the first map),
- or alcohol consumption (in the second map). 

In this data representation, we can better visualize each county's levels of tobacco and alcohol use. We can use this data from the chart to better identify any correlation between these levels and the health data of that county. 
For example, the reason for a higher premature death rate in Swain County is probably linked to the extensive use of tobacco and alcohol consumption. The use of tobacco and alcohol can eventually lead to many health complications and excessive use can have severe health complications.
