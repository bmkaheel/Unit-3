    "The **second** subset above can be used to provide more detail on the second analysis area regarding a tax impose tobacco and alcohol consumption. Smoking and alcohol-use has long be correlated to negative health and this is a contributing factor to the negative health rates of counties, some more than others. We can see from the data set below the rates at which adults engage in either smoking or excessive drinking and this habits, if stopped or even limited, can increase the health rates of these counties immensely and this is can be done by imposing an additional tax on those products in an attempt to limit the purchasing of them. Another idea that may help people get away from the use of tobacco and alcohol could be by limiting their free time and giving them something else to do. This could be done by proposing a tax break for exercise and fitness related products and activities bring individuals to healtier habits rather than detremental ones. "

    "The **third** subset can be used to provide more detail on the third analysis area regarding income and increased funding to a specific area. Although increased funding can be very impactful from a lot of aspects, if we include every column impacted by funding, this subset would be extremely close to the original raw data set. Therefore, we had to limit it down to include only a few critical points. We aimed to cover categories from four different aspects. These categories are:\n",

CSV files or Comma-Separated Value files, are extremely dense data files and on an individual-level, they contain lots of irrelevant information. That is where coding like this comes into play. It makes navigatibility and usability much more simple and efficient."
